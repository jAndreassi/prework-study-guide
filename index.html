            1) What the code is doing as opposed to what the code is actually
            doing.
          </li>
          <li>
            2) Hunt for the bug within the code to see what is actually causing
            the problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            3) After the bug has been discovered try implementing different
            solutions to fix the bug.
          </li>
          <li>
            4) Once you have implemented a fix, test the app to make sure
            changes are effective and no new bugs were added. There are
            different tools and procedures for tesing a bug fix, will need to
            choose the best tool and process to help fix the project.
          </li>
          <li>
            5) Document process used to achieve solution. Can help to refer back
            if same issue happens again.
